Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


## Output:



Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on translating one phrase at a time.
Here's a table of vocabulary to get us started:

English |	Japanese (Dictionary Form)
------- | ------
bear |	くま (kuma)
door |	ドア (doa)
garbage |	ごみ (gomi)
leave |	おきる (okiru)
at |	(we'll come back to this)

Now, let's think about the first part of the sentence: "Bears are at the door." How would you translate "bears" into Japanese? Remember to think about the correct form of the word.

### Student:
kuma

### Teacher
"Kuma" is the dictionary form of the word for "bear". Since we're referring to multiple bears, we'll need to add a suffix to indicate plurality. In Japanese, the suffix "~tachi" or "~ra" can be used to indicate a group or multiple objects. 

However, for animals, we often use "~tachi" or "~gumi", but for bears, "~tachi" is more common.

So, how would you write "bears" in Japanese?
(Remember, I'm not giving away the answer just yet!)

### Student:
kumatachi

### Teacher
"Kumatachi" is the correct way to refer to multiple bears in Japanese. Well done!

Now, let's move on to the next part of the sentence: "are at the door". We need to think about how to express the idea of "being at" or "located at" something in Japanese.

Here's a hint: we often use a specific verb in Japanese to indicate the location or existence of something.

Take a look at the vocabulary table again. Can you think of a way to express "are at" in Japanese?
