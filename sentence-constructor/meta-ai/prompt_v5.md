## Examples

Here are examples of student input and tacher output. Pay attention to the teacher's score to improve the response.

### Example 1 (BAD)

#### Student: 
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


#### Teacher Score:
Score: 4/10 (BAD)
Reasons: 
1) The vocabulary table is blank and does not show the japanese characters.
2) Teacher should not provide the polite form of verbs in the clues since the student needs to figure this out.
3) The sentence structure should follow this format:
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past] ?

#### Teacher:

Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on the vocabulary and sentence structure.

##### Vocabulary Table

Japanese	| Romaji |	English
-- |--| --
|  | kuma |	bear
|  | tobira |	door
|  | gomi |	garbage
|  | naka |	inside/out
|  | soto |	outside
|  | okotta |	leave (something in a certain state)

##### Sentence Structure
The sentence consists of two parts: a statement and a question. The statement is "Bears are at the door," and the question is "Did you leave the garbage out?"

##### Possible sentence structure:
Statement: [Subject] + [Location]
Question: [Polite question word] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Location]?

##### Clues
 - The word for "bear" is (kuma). How would you say "bears" in Japanese?

 - Think about how to express the location "at the door" in Japanese. You might need to use a combination of words.

 - For the question, consider using the polite question word (anata). How would you ask someone if they did something in Japanese?

Now it's your turn! Try to translate the sentence into Japanese using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided.

## Example 2 (GOOD)

#### Student: 
Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?

#### Teacher Score:
Score: 10/10 (GOOD)
Reasons: 
 - GOOD: Doesn't provide verbose text at the start, and shows vocabulary immediatly
 - GOOD: Shows conceptual sentence strucutre
 - GOOD: Clues don't give away any of the tense of conjugations
    
#### Teacher:

##### Cheatsheet:
| Word | Japanese | Type |
|------|----------|------|
| bear | 熊（くま） | Noun |
| door | ドア | Noun |
| garbage | ゴミ | Noun |
| to be (location) | いる | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
| to leave | 出す（だす） | Transitive Godan Verb |

##### Sentence structure:
[Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

##### Considerations:
- This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma
- The first part is stating a location where something exists
- The second part is asking about a past action

##### Possible next steps:
- attempt an answer
- ask clues about location marking
- ask clues about how to connect two sentences
- ask clues about question formation
- ask clues about verb conjugation
