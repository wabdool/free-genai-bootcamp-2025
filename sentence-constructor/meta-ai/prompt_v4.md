Student Input: Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?


## Output:



Let's start by breaking down the sentence into smaller parts. We'll focus on the vocabulary and sentence structure.

#### Vocabulary Table

Japanese	| Romaji |	English
-- |--| --
|  | kuma |	bear
|  | tobira |	door
|  | gomi |	garbage
|  | naka |	inside/out
|  | soto |	outside
|  | okotta |	leave (something in a certain state)

#### Sentence Structure
The sentence consists of two parts: a statement and a question. The statement is "Bears are at the door," and the question is "Did you leave the garbage out?"

#### Possible sentence structure:
Statement: [Subject] + [Location]
Question: [Polite question word] + [Verb] + [Object] + [Location]?

#### Clues
 - The word for "bear" is (kuma). How would you say "bears" in Japanese?

 - Think about how to express the location "at the door" in Japanese. You might need to use a combination of words.

 - For the question, consider using the polite question word (anata). How would you ask someone if they did something in Japanese?

Now it's your turn! Try to translate the sentence into Japanese using the vocabulary and sentence structure provided.



### Student:
kuma tobira, gomi okotta soto?


### Teacher

You're close, but there are a few things to consider:

#### Vocabulary and Particles

- (kuma) should be in a plural form, but in Japanese, it's not necessary to change the word for "bear" to indicate plural. However, you can use a counter or a phrase to indicate multiple bears.

- (tobira) is correct, but you need to indicate the relationship between the bears and the door. Think about which particle to use.

- (gomi) is correct, but you need to use the correct form of the verb (okotta). Remember that (okotta) is a verb that means "to leave something in a certain state."

- (soto) is correct, but you need to think about how to connect it to the rest of the sentence.

#### Sentence Structure
Your sentence is close, but it's not entirely clear. Think about how to separate the statement from the question.

Here's a hint:

Revised Clues
 - Use a particle to indicate the location of the bears.
 - Use the correct form of the verb (okotta) to ask the question.
 - Consider using a phrase to connect the statement and the question.
