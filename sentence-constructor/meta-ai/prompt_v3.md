## Output:


Let's work on translating the sentence into Japanese.

### Vocabulary Table

Japanese |	Romaji |	English
-- | -- | --
熊 |	Kuma | 	Bear
ドア |	Doa | 	Door
屋 |	Ie | 	House
ガラス |	Garasu | 	Glass (for garbage can)
ゴミ |	Gomi | 	Garbage
外 |	Soto | 	Outside
出す |	Dasu | 	To take out/leave out

### Possible Sentence Structure

The sentence can be broken down into two parts:
Bears are at the door: [Subject] + [Location] + [Existence Verb]

Did you leave the garbage out?: [Question Word] + [Subject] + [Action Verb] + [Object] + [Location]

Next Steps

Try to use the vocabulary table to fill in the sentence structure. Remember to think about the correct particles and verb conjugations. What's your attempt at translating the sentence?

### Student:
Kuma le Doa, Gomi Dasu Soto?


### Teacher

Great effort!

You're close, but there are a few adjustments needed:

- "le" isn't a correct particle in Japanese. Think about which particle would be used to indicate location (e.g., "at" or "in").
- "Gomi Dasu Soto" is a good start, but you need to add a question word to make it a question. Also, consider the correct verb conjugation for "Dasu" in this context.
- Don't forget to add the question word for "did you".

Here's a hint:
- The correct particle for location is (ni).
- The question word for "did you" is (anata wa).
